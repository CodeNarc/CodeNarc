Version 0.16 (November 2011)
-------------------------------------------

New Feaures
 - Performance Improvements (3394481)  - There are big performance improvements in this release.
 - Upgrade to GMetrics 0.4. (3424121)  - This upgrade is optional for users, but may provide performance improvements.
 - Rule Index page: Rule name is now a link to the rule description web page. (3434063)

New and Updated Rules
 - @SuppressWarnings Support  - The support for @SuppressWarnings was redesigned so that it is more reliable. @SuppressWarnings no works on *all* rules at the Class, Field, and Method level.
 - CouldBeElvis rule (convention)  - Catch an if block that could be written as an elvis expression.
 - LongLiteralWithLowerCaseL rule (convention)  - In Java and Groovy, you can specify long literals with the L or l character, for instance 55L or 24l. It is best practice to always use an uppercase L and never a lowercase l. This is because 11l rendered in some fonts may look like 111 instead of 11L.
 - ConfusingMultipleReturns rule (groovyism)  - Multiple return values can be used to set several variables at once. To use multiple return values, the left hand side of the assignment must be enclosed in parenthesis. If not, then you are not using multiple return values, you're only assigning the last element.
 - GetterMethodCouldBeProperty rule (groovyism)  - If a class defines a public method that follows the Java getter notation, and returns a constant, then it is cleaner to provide a Groovy property for the value rather than a Groovy method.
 - UnnecessaryDefInMethodDeclaration rule (unnecessary)  - 3176230  - Rule now catches when you try to add the def keyword to constructor declarations. Also expanded to catch more instances of in method declarations with explicit return types.
 - UnnecessaryDefInFieldDeclaration rule (unnecessary)  - If a field has a visibility modifier or a type declaration, then the def keyword is unneeded. For instance, 'static def constraints = {}' is redundant and can be simplified to 'static constraints = {}.
 - UnnecessaryDefInVariableDeclaration rule (unnecessary)  - Expanded rule to catch more instances of unneeded defs.
 - UnusedMethodParameter rule (unused)  - This rule finds instances of method parameters not being used. It does not analyze private methods (that is done by the UnusedPrivateMethodParameter rule) or methods marked @Override.
 - BuilderMethodWithSideEffects rule (design)  - 3408045  - A builder method is defined as one that creates objects. As such, they should never be of void return type. If a method is named build, create, or make, then it should always return a value.
 - MisorderedStaticImportRule  - 3392892  - The rule now allows you to specify that static imports come after the other imports, not just before.  This rule has one property comesBefore, which defaults to true. If you like your static imports to come after the others, then set this property to false.
 - FactoryMethodName rule (naming)  - A factory method is a method that creates objects, and they are typically named either buildFoo(), makeFoo(), or createFoo(). This rule enforces that only one naming convention is used. It defaults to makeFoo(), but that can be changed using the property 'regex'.
 - UseCollectMany rule (groovyism)  - 3411722  - In many case collectMany() yields the same result as collect{}.flatten. It is easier to understand and more clearly conveys the intent.
 - CollectAllIsDeprecated rule (groovyism)  - 3411724  - collectAll is deprecated since Groovy 1.8.1. Use collectNested instead
 - UseCollectNested rule (groovyism)  - 3411724  - Instead of nested collect{}-calls use collectNested{}
 - DuplicateMapLiteral (dry)  - 3413600  - Check for multiple instances of the same Map literal; limited to Maps where the keys and values are all constants or literals.
 - DuplicateListLiteral (dry)  - 3413601  - Check for multiple instances of the same List literal; limited to Lists where the values are all constants or literals.

  - #3429658: False positive for UnusedPrivateMethod rule
  - #3387422: ClosureAsLastMethodParameter  - false positive

Breaking Changes
 * The HardcodedWindowsRootDirectory has been renamed to HardCodedWindowsRootDirectory. (#3433741)
 * Major Reorganization of the "Basic" RuleSet. (#3432475)
  This included moving several rules from the "Basic" ruleset to other rulesets, as well as adding two New Rulesets:
      1. "Groovyism"  - Groovy idiomatic usage, and Groovy-specific bad practices
      2. "Convention"  - Coding conventions; not typically errors.

  The following rules were moved out of the "Basic" ruleset:
   - AddEmptyString                      (unnecessary)
   - AssignCollectionSort                (groovyism)
   - AssignCollectionUnique              (groovyism)
   - BooleanMethodReturnsNull            (design)
   - CloneableWithoutClone               (design)
   - ClosureAsLastMethodParameter        (groovyism)
   - CollectAllIsDeprecated              (groovyism)
   - CompareToWithoutComparable          (design)
   - ConfusingMultipleReturns            (groovyism)
   - ConfusingTernary                    (convention)
   - ConsecutiveLiteralAppends           (unnecessary)
   - ConsecutiveStringConcatenation      (unnecessary)
   - CouldBeElvis                        (convention)
   - ExplicitArrayListInstantiation      (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToAndMethod             (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToCompareToMethod       (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToDivMethod             (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToEqualsMethod          (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToGetAtMethod           (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToLeftShiftMethod       (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToMinusMethod           (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToModMethod             (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToMultiplyMethod        (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToOrMethod              (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToPlusMethod            (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToPowerMethod           (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToRightShiftMethod      (groovyism)
   - ExplicitCallToXorMethod             (groovyism)
   - ExplicitHashMapInstantiation        (groovyism)
   - ExplicitHashSetInstantiation        (groovyism)
   - ExplicitLinkedHashMapInstantiation  (groovyism)
   - ExplicitLinkedListInstantiation     (groovyism)
   - ExplicitStackInstantiation          (groovyism)
   - ExplicitTreeSetInstantiation        (groovyism)
   - GStringAsMapKey                     (groovyism)
   - GroovyLangImmutable                 (groovyism)
   - InvertedIfElse                      (convention)
   - LongLiteralWithLowerCaseL           (convention)
   - ReturnsNullInsteadOfEmptyArray      (design)
   - ReturnsNullInsteadOfEmptyCollection (design)
   - SimpleDateFormatMissingLocale       (design)
   - UseCollectMany                      (groovyism)
   - UseCollectNested                    (groovyism)

  The ruleset parser classes have been modified to print a helpful error message for moved and renamed rules (see MovedRules helper class).
 * In a previous version, method names on AbstractAstVisitor were changed to add @SuppressWarnings support. visitField became visitFieldEx, visitProperty became visitPropertyEx, and visitConstructor became visitConstructorEx. These were changed back to the default names used by Groovy visitors.

Thanks
 - Thanks to the Groovy Users of Minnesota for the CouldBeElvis rule. Thanks Jeff Beck, Doug Sabers, Ryan Applegate, and Mike Minner.
 - Thanks to Joachim Baumann for UseCollectMany, CollectAllIsDeprecated, UseCollectNested.

Version 0.15 (August 2011)
-------------------------------------------

New and Updated Rules
 - UnnecessaryDefInVariableDeclaration rule (unnecessary)  - If a variable has a visibility modifier or a type declaration, then the def keyword is unneeded. For instance 'def private n = 2' is redundant and can be simplified to 'private n = 2'.
 - UnnecessaryDefInMethodDeclaration rule (unnecessary)  - Added more checked modifiers: final, synchronized, abstract, strictfp. Multiple method declarations in a single line are handled correctly.
 - AssignCollectionUnique rule (basic)  - The Collections.unique() method mutates the list and returns the list as a value. If you are assigning the result of unique() to a variable, then you probably don't realize that you're also modifying the original list as well. This is frequently the cause of subtle bugs.
 - AssignCollectionSort rule (basic)  - The Collections.sort() method mutates the list and returns the list as a value. If you are assigning the result of sort() to a variable, then you probably don't realize that you're also modifying the original list as well. This is frequently the cause of subtle bugs.
 - UnnecessaryDotClass rule (unnecessary)  - To make a reference to a class, it is unnecessary to specify the '.class' identifier. For instance String.class can be shortened to String.
 - BitwiseOperatorInConditional rule (basic)  - Checks for bitwise operations in conditionals, if you need to do a bitwise operation then it is best practive to extract a temp variable.
 - UnnecessaryInstanceOfCheck rule (unnecessary)  - This rule finds instanceof checks that cannot possibly evaluate to true. For instance, checking that (!variable instanceof String) will never be true because the result of a not expression is always a boolean.
 - UnnecessarySubstring rule (unnecessary)  - This rule finds usages of String.substring(int) and String.substring(int, int) that can be replaced by use of the subscript operator. For instance, var.substring(5) can be replaced with var[5..-1].
 - HardcodedWindowsRootDirectory rule (basic)  - This rule find cases where a File object is constructed with a windows-based path. This is not portable, and using the File.listRoots() method is a better alternative.
 - HardCodedWindowsFileSeparator rule (basic)  - This rule finds usages of a Windows file separator within the constructor call of a File object. It is better to use the Unix file separator or use the File.separator constant.
 - RandomDoubleCoercedToZero rule (basic)  - The Math.random() method returns a double result greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. If you coerce this result into an Integer or int, then it is coerced to zero. Casting the result to int, or assigning it to an int field is probably a bug.
 - BracesForClass rule (formatting)  - Checks the location of the opening brace ({) for classes. By default, requires them on the same line, but the sameLine property can be set to false to override this.
 - LineLength rule (formatting)  - Checks the maximum length for each line of source code. It checks for number of characters, so lines that include tabs may appear longer than the allowed number when viewing the file. The maximum line length can be configured by setting the length property, which defaults to 120.
 - GrailsDomainHasToString rule (grails)  - Checks that Grails domain classes redefine toString()
 - GrailsDomainHasEquals rule (grails)  - Checks that Grails domain classes redefine equals().
 - BracesForForLoop rule (formatting)  - Checks the location of the opening brace ({) for for loops. By default, requires them on the same line, but the sameLine property can be set to false to override this.
 - BracesForIfElse rule (formatting)  - Checks the location of the opening brace ({) for if statements. By default, requires them on the same line, but the sameLine property can be set to false to override this.
 - BracesForMethod rule (formatting)  - Checks the location of the opening brace ({) for constructors and methods. By default, requires them on the same line, but the sameLine property can be set to false to override this.
 - BracesForTryCatchFinally rule (formatting)  - Checks the location of the opening brace ({) for try statements. By default, requires them on the line, but the sameLine property can be set to false to override this.
 - ClassJavadoc rule (formatting)  - Makes sure each class and interface definition is preceded by javadoc. Enum definitions are not checked, due to strange behavior in the Groovy AST.
 - JdbcConnectionReference rule (jdbc)  - Check for direct use of java.sql.Connection, which is discouraged and almost never necessary in application code.
 - JdbcResultSetReference rule (jdbc)  - Check for direct use of java.sql.ResultSet, which is not necessary if using the Groovy Sql facility or an ORM framework such as Hibernate.
 - JdbcStatementReference rule (jdbc)  - Check for direct use of java.sql.Statement, java.sql.PreparedStatement, or java.sql.CallableStatement, which is not necessary if using the Groovy Sql facility or an ORM framework such as Hibernate.
 - IllegalClassReference rule (generic)  - Checks for reference to any of the classes configured in classNames.

Version 0.14 (June 2011)
-------------------------------------------

New and Updated Rules
 - ExplicitLinkedHashMapInstantiation rule (basic)  - This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of a LinkedHashMap using the no-arg constructor. In Groovy, it is best to write "new LinkedHashMap()" as "[:]", which creates the same object.
 - DuplicateMapKey rule (basic)  - A map literal is created with duplicated key. The map entry will be overwritten.
 - DuplicateSetValue rule (basic)  - A Set literal is created with duplicate constant value. A set cannot contain two elements with the same value.
 - EqualsOverloaded rule (basic)  - The class has an equals method, but the parameter of the method is not of type Object. It is not overriding equals but instead overloading it.
 - ForLoopShouldBeWhileLoop (basic)  - A for-loop without an init and an update statement can be simplified to a while loop.
 - NonFinalSubclassOfSensitiveInterface rule (security)  - The permissions classes such as java.security.Permission and java.security.BasicPermission are designed to be extended. Classes that derive from these permissions classes, however, must prohibit extension. This prohibition ensures that malicious subclasses cannot change the properties of the derived class. Classes that implement sensitive interfaces such as java.security.PrivilegedAction and java.security.PrivilegedActionException must also be declared final for analogous reasons.
 - ImportFromSunPackages rule (imports)  - Avoid importing anything from the 'sun.*' packages. These packages are not portable and are likely to change.
 - UnnecessaryFinalOnPrivateMethod rule (unnecessary)  - A private method is marked final. Private methods cannot be overridden, so marking it final is unnecessary.
 - InsecureRandom rule (security)  - Reports usages of java.util.Random, which can produce very predictable results. If two instances of Random are created with the same seed and sequence of method calls, they will generate the exact same results. Use java.security.SecureRandom instead, which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator. SecureRandom uses PRNG, which means they are using a deterministic algorithm to produce a pseudo-random number from a true random seed. SecureRandom produces non-deterministic output.
 - DirectConnectionManagement rule (jdbc)  - The J2EE standard requires that applications use the container's resource management facilities to obtain connections to resources. Every major web application container provides pooled database connection management as part of its resource management framework. Duplicating this functionality in an application is difficult and error prone, which is part of the reason it is forbidden under the J2EE standard.
 - ComparisonWithSelf (basic)  - Checks for using a comparison operator or equals() or compareTo() to compare a variable to itself, e.g.: x == x, x != x, x <=> x, x < x, x > x, x <= x, x >= x, x.equals(x), or x.compareTo(x), where x is a variable.
 - ComparisonOfTwoConstants (basic)  - Checks for using a comparison operator or equals() or compareTo() to compare two constants to each other or two literals that contain only constant values.
 - FileCreateTempFile rule (security)  - The File.createTempFile() method is insecure, and has been deprecated by the ESAPI secure coding library. It has been replaced by the ESAPI Randomizer.getRandomFilename(String) method.
 - SystemExit rule (security)  - Web applications should never call System.exit(). A call to System.exit() is probably part of leftover debug code or code imported from a non-J2EE application.
 - ObjectFinalize rule (security)  - The finalize() method should only be called by the JVM after the object has been garbage collected.
 - JavaIoPackageAccess rule (security)  - This rule reports violations of the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using the java.io package to access files or the file system.
 - UnsafeArrayDeclaration rule (security)  - Triggers a violation when an array is declared public, final, and static. Secure coding principles state that, in most cases, an array declared public, final and static is a bug because arrays are mutable objects.
 - PublicFinalizeMethod rule (security)  - Creates a violation when the program violates secure coding principles by declaring a finalize() method public.
 - NonFinalPublicField rule (security)  - Finds code that violates secure coding principles for mobile code by declaring a member variable public but not final.
 - UnnecessaryElseStatement rule (unnecessary)  - When an if statement block ends with a return statement the else is unnecessary. The logic in the else branch can be run without being in a new scope.
 - StaticConnection rule (concurrency)  - Creates violations when a java.sql.Connection object is used as a static field. Database connections stored in static fields will be shared between threads, which is unsafe and can lead to race conditions.
 - UnnecessaryPackageReference (unnecessary)  - Checks for explicit package reference for classes that Groovy imports by default, such as java.lang.String, java.util.Map and groovy.lang.Closure.
 - AbstractClassWithPublicConstructor (design)  - Checks for abstract classes that define a public constructor, which is useless and confusing.
 - StaticSimpleDateFormatField (concurrency)  - Checks for static SimpleDateFormat fields. SimpleDateFormat objects are not threadsafe, and should not be shared across threads.
 - IllegalPackageReference (generic)  - Checks for reference to any of the packages configured in packageNames.
 - SpockIgnoreRestUsed rule (junit)  - If Spock's @IgnoreRest appears on any method, then all non-annotated test methods are not executed. This behaviour is almost always unintended. It's fine to use @IgnoreRest locally during development, but when committing code, it should be removed.
 - SwallowThreadDeath rule (exceptions)  - Detects code that catches java.lang.ThreadDeath without rethrowing it
 - MisorderedStaticImports rule (imports)  - Static imports should never be declared after nonstatic imports.
 - ConfusingMethodName (naming)  - Existing rule updated to analyze fields and field names as well as just methods.
 - PublicInstanceField rule (design)  - Using public fields is considered to be a bad design. Use properties instead.
 - UnnecessaryNullCheck (unnecessary)  - Updated rule to flag null and not-null checks against the this reference. The this reference can never be null.
 - ClassForName rule (basic)  - Using Class.forName(...) is a common way to add dynamic behavior to a system. However, using this method can cause resource leaks because the classes can be pinned in memory for long periods of time.
 - StatelessSingleton rule (design)  - Rule finds occurrences of the Singleton pattern where the object has no state (mutable or otherwise). There is no point in creating a stateless Singleton, just make a new instance with the new keyword instead.
 - InconsistentPropertySynchronization rule (concurrency)  - The rule is a little smarter now and flags code that defines a synchronized getter without any setter and vice versa. Those methods will be generated in unsynchronized from by the Groovy compiler later.
 - ClosureAsLastMethodParameter rule (basic)  - If a method is called and the last parameter is an inline closure then it can be declared outside of the method call brackets.
 - SerialPersistentFields rule (serialization)  - To use a Serializable object's serialPersistentFields correctly, it must be declared private, static, and final.
 - UnnecessaryParenthesesForMethodCallWithClosure rule (unnecessary)  - If a method is called and the only parameter to that method is an inline closure then the brackets of the method call can be omitted.

Bug Fixes and New Features
  - Groovy 1.8 Support  - CodeNarc continues to be built with Groovy 1.7, but should be able to be run with a Groovy 1.8 Runtime.
  - #3290486  - AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod no longer flags marker interfaces as abstract classes that do not define a method.
  - #3202691  - ClassNameRule rule is changed to handle $ in the class name, which is in Inner and Nested classes by default.
  - #3206167  - VariableNameRule now has a violation message that states the name of the variable and the regex it did not match.
  - #3206667  - FieldName, VariableName, MethodName, ParameterName, UnusedVariable, PropertyName, and UnusedPrivateField violations message now contains the class name of the enclosing class. This helps you configure an exclude.
  - #3206258  - LoggerForDifferentClass rule now accepts MyClass.name as a valid name for the logger.
  - #3206238  - The DuplicateNumberLiteral rule now allows you to ignore literals in the 1.2d, 1.2f, and 1.2G format.
  - #3207628  - The UnusedPrivateMethodParameter rule now allows you to ignore parameters by name. By default, parameters named 'ignore' and 'ignored' do not trigger a violation. You can configure this with the 'ignoreRegex' property on the rule.
  - #3205696  - The ConsecutiveStringConcatenation rule no longer suggesting that you join numbers together, it only suggests joining strings together.
  - #3206150  - Fixed UnusedGroovyImport rule so that imports with aliases are ignored and do not cause violations.
  - #3207605  - Fixed UnusedPrivateMethod rule to recognize static method references.
  - #3207607  - Fixed UnusedPrivateMethod rule to recognize access of privately defined getters and setters as properties.
  - #3205697  - Fixed bug where the source line displayed for annotated nodes was sometimes showing just the annotation and not the node.
  - #3288895  - Expand default test file regex pattern to include *TestCase
  - #3291474  - Enhance StaticDateFormatFieldRule to also check for static fields initialized to a DateFormat, e.g. static final DATE_FORMAT = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG)
  - #3291559  - Enhance StaticCalendarFieldRule to also check for untyped static fields that are initialized to a Calendar, e.g. static final CALENDAR = Calendar.getInstance()
  - #3293429  - Fix UnnecessaryNullCheck duplicate violations.
  - #3295887  - Fix AddEmptyString duplicate violations.
  - #3299713  - Fix ImportFromSamePackage, UnnecessaryGroovyImport: Star import.
  - #3300225  - Fix UnnecessaryGroovyImport: Check static imports.
  - #3290324  - Fix UnnecessarySemicolon: the contents of multiline strings and GStrings are no longer checked, just the strings themselves. For example, embedding JavaScript or Java within a Multi-line String would previously trigger the violation.
  - #3305896  - Fix LoggerForDifferentClass: The rule now correctly handles inner classes (that are not static)
  - #3305019  - Updated the EmptyCatchBlockRule so that exceptions named ignore or ignored will not trigger errors. The name is configurable.
  - #3309062  - UnnecessaryGroovyImportRule handles static imports incorrectly
  - Fixed the Explicit[Collection]Instantiation rules so that the error messages are more descriptive.
  - Fixed the InconsistentPropertySynchronization rule so that it recognizes the new @Synchronized annotation.
  - #3308930  - LoggerWithWrongModifiersRule now contains a parameter 'allowProtectedLogger' so that loggers can also be instantiated as 'protected final LOG = Logger.getLogger(this.class)'. Also, it has a 'allowNonStatic' logger property, that allows you to create a non static logger.
  - #3308930  - LoggerForDifferentClassRule now contains a parameter 'allowDerivedClasses'. When set, a logger may be created about this.getClass().
  - #3309748  - FieldName:Do not treat non-static final fields as constants
  - #3310413  - Fix UnnecessaryPublicModifier does not catch public on constructors.
  - #3310521  - For all ExplicitCallToXxxMethod rules: Ignore calls to super.Xxx(). Patch from René Scheibe
  - #3313550  - Some HTML violation descriptions in the properties files were not well-formed HTML. This has been fixed.
  - #3205688  - Fixed false positives in UseAssertEqualsInsteadOfAssertTrue when using the JUnit assertFalse method.

Breaking Changes
 * Moved the following rules out of the "basic" ruleset into the new "serialization" ruleset:
    - SerialVersionUID
    - SerializableClassMustDefineSerialVersionUID
 * Moved import-specific helper methods out of AbstractRule into ImportUtil.
 * The ExplicitTypeInstantiationAstVisitor is now an abstract class that requires you to specify a custom violation message. This should affect no one, but it is a backwards breaking change. ppp

Version 0.13 (February 2011)
-------------------------------------------

New Features
 - New and improved syntax for defining custom rulesets. Just list the rule names you want. No need to specify
  ruleset filename or rule class. No more tweaking your custom rulesets with every CodeNarc release when we
  add New Rules to the "basic" ruleset or one of the others. Feature #3193684.
 - Better support for command line runners. You can now specify the report type "console" as a command line parameter,
  and the CodeNarc text report is output to the console instead of a file. Feature #3162487
 - All rules now provide a nicely formatted message. This makes console tools and the CodeNarc Web Console much more
  user friendly. Feature #3162847
 - Greatly improved styling of the HTML report. Feature #3192593
 - Improved error messages when CodeNarc is mis-configured and configuration file does not compile. Feature #3193468
 - Improved println rule. If a class defines a println method, then it is OK to call this method because it won't dispatch to System.out.println. Feature #3194121
 - Improved NestedBlockDepth rule. Method calls on builder objects are now ignored, so you can nest builder calls arbitrarily deep. What constitutes a builder is exposed in the ignoreRegex property, which defaults to '.*(b|B)uilder'.

New Rules
  Dead/Unnecessary Code
 - EmptyInstanceInitializer rule (basic)  - Feature #3163464  - An empty instance initializer. It is safe to remove it.
 - EmptyStaticInitializer rule (basic)  - Feature #3161685  - An empty static initializer was found. It is safe to remove it.
 - EmptyMethod rule (basic)  - Feature #3163806  - A method was found without an implementation. If the method is overriding or implementing a parent method, then mark it with the @Override annotation.
 - UnnecessaryCallToSubstring rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3164688  - Calling String.substring(0) always returns the original string. This code is meaningless.
 - UnnecessaryModOne rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3164684  - Any expression mod 1 (exp % 1) is guaranteed to always return zero. This code is probably an error, and should be either (exp & 1) or (exp % 2).
 - UnnecessarySelfAssignment rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3164674  - Method contains a pointless self-assignment to a variable or property.
 - UnnecessaryTransientModifier rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3164672  - The field is marked as transient, but the class isn't Serializable, so marking it as transient has no effect.
 - UnnecessaryFail rule (junit)  - Feature #3105925  - In a unit test, catching an exception and immediately calling Assert.fail() is pointless and hides the stack trace. It is better to rethrow the exception or not catch the exception at all.
 - UnnecessaryPublicModifier rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3166320  - The 'public' modifier is not required on methods or classes.
 - UnnecessaryDefInMethodDeclaration rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3165469  - If a method has a visibility modifier, then the def keyword is unneeded. For instance 'def private method() {}' is redundant and can be simplified to 'private method() {}'.
 - UnnecessarySemicolon rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3176207  - Semicolons as line terminators are not required in Groovy: remove them. Do not use a semicolon as a replacement for empty braces on for and while loops; this is a confusing practice.
 - UnnecessaryGString rule (unnecessary)  - Feature #3183521  - String objects should be created with single quotes, and GString objects created with double quotes. Creating normal String objects with double quotes is confusing to readers.

  Bugs/Bad Practices
 - AssignmentInConditional rule (basic)  - An assignment operator (=) was used in a conditional test. This is usually a typo, and the comparison operator (==) was intended.
 - SerializableClassMustDefineSerialVersionUID rule (basic)  - Feature #3161076  - Classes that implement Serializable should define a serialVersionUID.
 - ConsecutiveStringConcatenation rule (basic)  - Feature #3163826  - Catches concatenation of two string literals on the same line. These can safely by joined.
 - ConsecutiveLiteralAppends rule (basic)  - Feature #3161779  - Violations occur when method calls to append(Object) are chained together with literals as parameters. The chained calls can be joined into one invocation.
 - AddEmptyString rule (basic)  - Feature #3161763  - Finds empty string literals which are being added. This is an inefficient way to convert any type to a String.
 - BrokenOddnessCheck rule (basic)  - Feature #3164687  - The code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work for negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check for oddness, consider using x & 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0.
 - ExceptionExtendsError rule (exceptions)  - Feature #3161749  - Errors are system exceptions. Do not extend them.
 - MissingNewInThrowStatementRule (exceptions)  - Feature #3166115  - Improved existing rule to catch throwing a class literal, which always causes a RuntimeException.
 - UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEquals (junit)  - Feature #3172959  - This rule was expanded to handle assert statements as well as JUnit style assertions.
 - GroovyLangImmutable rule (basic)  - Feature #3175158  - The groovy.lang.Immutable annotation has been deprecated and replaced by groovy.transform.Immutable. Do not use the Immutable in groovy.lang.
 - IntegerGetInteger rule (basic)  - Feature #3174771  - This rule catches usages of java.lang.Integer.getInteger(String, ...) which reads an Integer from the System properties. It is often mistakenly used to attempt to read user input or parse a String into an Integer. It is a poor piece of API to use; replace it with System.properties['prop'].
 - BooleanGetBoolean rule (basic)  - Feature #3174770  - This rule catches usages of java.lang.Boolean.getBoolean(String) which reads a boolean from the System properties. It is often mistakenly used to attempt to read user input or parse a String into a boolean. It is a poor piece of API to use; replace it with System.properties['prop?'].
 - ChainedTest rule (junit)  - Feature #3175647  - A test methodency that invokes another test method is a chained test; the methods are dependent on one another. Tests should be isolated, and not be dependent on one another.
 - CoupledTestCase rule (junit)  - Feature #3175645  - This rule finds test cases that are coupled to other test cases, either by invoking static methods on another test case or by creating instances of another test case. If you require shared logic in test cases then extract that logic to a new class where it can properly be reused.

  Concurrency Problems
 - BusyWait rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3170271  - Busy waiting (forcing a Thread.sleep() while waiting on a condition) should be avoided. Prefer using the gate and barrier objects in the java.util.concurrent package.
 - DoubleCheckedLocking rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3170263  - This rule detects double checked locking, where a 'lock hint' is tested for null before initializing an object within a synchronized block. Double checked locking does not guarantee correctness and is an anti-pattern.
 - InconsistentPropertyLocking rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3164700  - Class contains similarly-named get and set methods where one method of the pair is marked either @WithReadLock or @WithWriteLock and the other is not locked at all.
 - InconsistentPropertySynchronization rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3164699  - Class contains similarly-named get and set methods where the set method is synchronized and the get method is not, or the get method is synchronized and the set method is not.
 - StaticCalendarField rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3164702  - Calendar objects should not be used as static fields. Calendars are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application.
 - StaticDateFormatField rule (concurrency)  - DateFormat objects should not be used as static fields. DateFormat are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application.
 - StaticMatcherField rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3170276  - Matcher objects should not be used as static fields. Calendars are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application.
 - SynchronizedOnBoxedPrimitive rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3164708  - The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer. Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock
 - SynchronizedOnReentrantLock rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3170262  - Synchronizing on a ReentrantLock field is almost never the intended usage. A ReentrantLock should be obtained using the lock() method and released in a finally block using the unlock() method.
 - SynchronizedOnString rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3164707  - Synchronization on a String field can lead to deadlock because Strings are interned by the JVM and can be shared.
 - SynchronizedReadObjectMethod rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3164704  - Catches Serializable classes that define a synchronized readObject method. By definition, an object created by deserialization is only reachable by one thread, and thus there is no need for readObject() to be synchronized. If the readObject() method itself is causing the object to become visible to another thread, that is an example of very dubious coding style.
 - ThreadGroup rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3161692  - Avoid using ThreadGroup; although it is intended to be used in a threaded environment it contains methods that are not thread safe.
 - VolatileArrayField rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3170265  - Volatile array fields are unsafe because the contents of the array are not treated as volatile. Changing the entire array reference is visible to other threads, but changing an array element is not.
 - WaitOutsideOfWhileLoop rule (concurrency)  - Feature #3127703  - Calls to Object.wait() must be within a while loop. This ensures that the awaited condition has not already been satisfied by another thread before the wait() is invoked. It also ensures that the proper thread was resumed and guards against incorrect notification.

Bug Fixes
 - Fix Bug #3162499 UnnecessaryObjectReferences: This rule was not ignoring 'this' references, leading to false positives.
 - Fix Bug #3164150 UnnecessaryReturnKeyword: Rule is no longer triggered if the return is for a closure.
 - Fix Bug #3165139 LoggingSwallowsStacktrace: No longer reports multiple logger errors.
 - Fix bug #3166311: Error on numeric/boolean property values if they contain leading or trailing whitespace in "codenarc.properties" or in XML ruleset file.
 - Fix bug #3170295: @SuppressWarnings does not work with GMetrics-based rules (CC and ABC).
 - Fix bug #3190483: The UnusedPrivateField rule now ignores fields named serialVersionUID. The rule has a property called ignoreFieldNames that can be used to add other ignores as well.
 - Fix bug #3162975: The UnusedPrivate* rules now correctly read anonymous classes.
 - Fix bug #3155974: The UnusedPrivate* rules now correctly read inner classes.
 - Fix bug #3183443: Restricted the ConfusingTernary rule to reduce false positives. The rule looks for inverted conditionals in ternary statements. It did not account for Groovy Truth, and suggested 'x != null' be inverted to 'x', but that is not the inverse. So the rule was relaxed.
 - Fix bug #3195027: The violation message for "Replace Getter with Property Access" suggests converting ".getURLs()" to ".uRLs". This has been corrected to ".URLs".
 - Fix bug #3196019: Compiling files with unresolved Grapes dependencies no longer causes an error.

Potential Breaking Changes
 - addViolation(ASTNode) is deprecated. Instead use addViolation(ASTNode, String) when adding violations to the output.

Potential Breaking Changes
 - Moved the existing StringInstantiation and BooleanInstantiation rules from the Basic ruleset into the Unnecessary ruleset.
  Also renamed the rules to UnnecessaryStringInstantiationRule and UnnecessaryBooleanInstantiation).
  Likewise, the rule classes were moved from the org.codenarc.rule.basic package into org.codenarc.rule.unnecessary.
  NOTE: This should only affect users if
    * You configured one of these rules specifically by rule name or by class name within a custom ruleset
    * You configured one of these rules (by rule name) within "codenarc.properties"
    * You configured one of these rules (by rule name) within a @SuppressWarnings annotation
    * You configured one of these rules (by rule name) within "codenarc-message.properties".
 - Removed deprecated applyToFilenames and doNotApplyToFilenames properties of AbstractRule.

Other Changes
 - UnnecessaryIfStatementRule: Expand the rule to also catch if/else statements that contain only single constant/literal expressions for the if and/or else blocks, if the if is not the last statement in the block.
 - Feature #3108153: Expand ReturnNull* rules to catch elvis operators
 - Feature #3111442: "add better error messages to the ReturnsNull*Rules"
 - Feature #3111440: "added better violation messages to BigDecimalInstantiationRule, BooleanInstantiationRule, and StringInstantiationRule".
 - Add isValid() to SourceCode (and AbstractSourceCode).

Version 0.11 (November 2010)
-------------------------------------------

New Features
 - @SuppressWarnings support. All rules now recognize the java.lang.SuppressWarnings annotation on fields, methods, and classes. If this annotation is added then there will be no violations produced. Just as in Java, the annotation requires a `String` or `List<String>` parameter. For example, annotating a class with @SuppressWarnings('UnusedPrivateField') will ignore the rule for that class. Annotating a method with @SuppressWarnings(['UnusedPrivateField', 'UnnecessaryIfStatementRule']) will ignore both rules for the annotated method.
 - Better "codenarc create-rule" support. You can create a new rule by running "codenarc create-rule" from the root of the CodeNarc codebase. This script has been updated to properly format Javadoc, prompt for the author name, and update the Maven Site .apt documentation.

New Rules
 - BooleanMethodReturnsNull Rule (basic) : Checks for a method with Boolean return type that returns an explicit null.
 - DeadCode Rule (basic) :  Checks for dead code that appears after a return statement or after an exception is thrown.
 - DoubleNegative Rule (basic) :  Checks for using a double negative, which is always positive.
 - DuplicateCaseStatement Rule (basic) :  Check for duplicate case statements in a switch block, such as two equal integers or strings.
 - ExplicitCallToAndMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the and(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the & operator.
 - ExplicitCallToCompareToMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the compareTo(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the <=>, >, >=, <, and <= operators.

 - UnnecessaryCollectionCall Rule (unnecessary) : Checks for useless calls to collections.
 - UnnecessaryOverridingMethod Rule (unnecessary) : Checks for an overriding method that merely calls the same method defined in a superclass.
 - UnnecessaryReturnKeyword Rule (unnecessary) :  In Groovy, the return keyword is often optional.
 - SynchronizedOnGetClass Rule (concurrency) : Checks for synchronization on getClass() rather than class literal.
 - UseOfNotifyMethod Rule (concurrency) : Checks for code that calls notify() rather than notifyAll().
 - DuplicateNumberLiteral Rule (dry) : This rule checks for duplicate number literals within the current class.
 - DuplicateStringLiteral Rule (dry) : This rule checks for duplicate String literals within the current class.
 - CatchIllegalMonitorStateException Rule (exceptions) : Dubious catching of IllegalMonitorStateException.

 - ReturnNullFromCatchBlock Rule (exceptions) : Returning null from a catch block often masks errors and requires the client to handle error codes.
 - UseAssertEqualsInsteadOfAssertTrue Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit assertions in object equality.
 - UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEqualsRule Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling assertEquals where the first parameter is a boolean.
 - UseAssertNullInsteadOfAssertEquals Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling assertEquals where the first or second parameter is null.
 - UseAssertSameInsteadOfAssertTrue Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling assertTrue or assertFalse where the first or second parameter is an Object#is() call testing for reference equality.
 - JUnitFailWithoutMessage Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling the fail() method without an argument.
 - JUnitStyleAssertions Rule (junit) : This rule detects calling JUnit style assertions like assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertNull, assertNotNull.
 - ConfusingMethodName Rule (naming) : Checks for very confusing method names. The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization.
 - ObjectOverrideMisspelledMethodName Rule (naming) : Verifies that the names of the most commonly overridden methods of Object: equals, hashCode and toString, are correct.
 - MethodCount Rule (size) : Checks if the number of methods within a class exceeds the number of lines specified by the maxMethod property.

Bug Fixes
 - None reported, none fixed!

Potential Breaking Changes
 - AbstractAstVisitor  - If you implemented your own rule by subclassing AbstractAstVisitor then your code might break. It is a compile error and the breakage will be clear and obvious. In order to support @SuppressWarnings, we needed to change AbstractAstVisitor. The method visitMethodNode became visitMethodNodeEx, visitClass became visitClassEx, visitConstructorOrMethod became visitConstructorOrMethodEx, visitField became visitFieldEx, visitProperty became visitPropertyEx, and visitConstructor became visitConstructorEx. From within these new methods there is no need to call super.visitX. In the rare case that the simple renaming does not fix your problem then please contact the mailing list.
 - The following three classes were moved from the org.codenarc.rule.basic package into org.codenarc.rule.unnecessary.
  Likewise, the associated rules were moved from the "basic" ruleset into the new "unnecessary" ruleset.
  You will need to adjust your ruleset configuration if you included one of these rules specifically in a custom ruleset, or configured them as part of the "basic" ruleset.
    * UnnecessaryBooleanExpressionRule
    * UnnecessaryIfStatementRule
    * UnnecessaryTernaryExpressionRule

Other Changes
 - CodeNarc now requires Groovy 1.7 to run. Keep in mind that it can still run against (analyze) older Groovy code.
 - There is a new rule set (category) called "dry", meaning "do not repeat yourself".
 - There is a new "unnecessary" rule set (category).
 - AstUtil enhancements  - For writers of rules: there are new utility methods in the AstUtil class. See the javadoc for more details.

Version 0.10 (26 September 2010)
-------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes
 - Fix Bug #3071531: "Unused rules don't recognized method closures". <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=3071531&group_id=250145>. e.g. private def bar() { }  .. return this.&bar;
 - Fix: UnusedPrivateField: Don't produce violation if field is a Closure field and is executed.
 - Fix: ImportFromSamePackage: Fix for (ignore) alias imports within same package.   package org.xyz;  import org.xyz.MyBigClass as MBC.

New Rules
 - New UnnecessaryIfStatementRule (basic):  Checks for if statements where the if and else blocks are only returning true and false constants. if(x) { return true } else { return false }.
 - New UnnecessaryBooleanExpressionRule (basic): Check for unnecessary boolean expressions, including ANDing (&&) or ORing (||) with true, false, null, or Map/List/String/Number literal. Also checks for negation of true, false, null, or Map/List/String/Number literal.
 - New BigDecimalInstantiationRule (basic): Avoid creating BigDecimal with a decimal (float/double) literal. Use a String literal. From PMD. See <http://pmd.sourceforge.net/rules/basic.html#AvoidDecimalLiteralsInBigDecimalConstructor>. Note that println new BigDecimal(0.1) prints out 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
 - UnusedObjectRule (unused): Checks for object allocations that are not assigned or used, unless it is the last statement within a block (because it may be the intentional return value).
 - New UnusedArrayRule (unused): This inspection reports any instances of Groovy array allocation where the array allocated is ignored. Such allocation expressions are legal Groovy, but are usually either inadvertent, or evidence of a very odd object initialization strategy. (IntelliJ). When an ExpressionStatement has as its expression an ArrayExpression.
 - Implement ImplementationAsTypeRule (design): Checks that particular classes are never used as types in variable declarations, return values or parameters. GregorianCalendar, HashMap, HashSet, Hashtable, LinkedList, LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, TreeMap, Vector, ArrayList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet, ConcurrentHashMap, ArrayBlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, DelayQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue, PriorityQueue, SynchronousQueue (see Checkstyle). (design)
 - New JUnitUnnecessaryTearDownRule (junit). Checks for tearDown() methods that only call super.tearDown().
 - New JUnitUnnecessarySetUpRule (junit). Checks for setUp() methods that only call super.setUp().

New Report Writer
 - New InlineXmlReportWriter (from Robin Bramley) for improved integration with the Hudson Violations plugin. See <http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations>.

Other Changes
 - CodeNarc now requires Groovy 1.6 to run. Keep in mind that it can still run against (analyze) older Groovy code.
 - Upgrade to GMetrics 0.3 for AbcComplexityRule and CyclomaticComplexityRule. Violations now include line number and source line.
 - All JUnit rules (`JUnit*Rule`): Also apply to classes with names ending in `*TestCase`.
 - Add codenarc create-rule script to create a new rule and associated classes/tests. <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3005873&group_id=250145&atid=1126575>. (Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - ConstantTernaryExpressionRule: Also flag constant Map and List expressions.
 - ConstantIfExpressionRule: Also flag constant Map and List expressions.
 - GrailsPublicControllerMethod: add ignoreMethodNames property.
 - Add reference to Sonar plugin. <http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Groovy+Plugin> to web site.
 - Add reference to Hudson Violations Plugin. <http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations> to web site.

Version 0.9 (10 May 2010)
------------------------------------

Bug Fixes
 - Fix bug #2985592: "MissingPropertyException: No such property: W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI".
 - XML RuleSet: Allow wildcards (*) in `<include>` and `<exclude>`.
 - WildcardPattern: Escape plus sign ('+').
 - NestedBlockDepthRule: Ignore first level of closure for Closure Fields (since they are really equivalent to methods).

New Size/Complexity Rules
 - AbcComplexityRule  - Check ABC size/complexity score against threshold for method and class average (size)
 - CyclomaticComplexityRule  - Check Cyclomatic Complexity against threshold for method and class average (size)

New Concurrency Rules
 - NestedSynchronizationRule (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - RunFinalizersOnExitRule (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - SynchronizedMethodRule (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - SynchronizedOnThisRule (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - ThreadLocalNotStaticFinalRule (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - ThreadYieldRule: (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)
 - VolatileLongOrDoubleFieldRule: (concurrency  - Hamlet D'Arcy)

New Basic Rules
 - CloneableWithoutCloneRule (basic  - Hamlet D'Arcy & René Groeschke)
 - ConstantIfExpressionRule: if(true) or if(false). Or literal constant. (basic)
 - ConstantTernaryExpressionRule: true ? x : y or false, null or literal.(basic)
 - UnnecessaryTernaryExpressionRule: x ? true : false. Or Boolean.TRUE. Or where both expressions are the same. (basic)

Other Changes
 - Deprecate GrailsSessionReferenceRule. Default enabled to false. Note in online docs.
 - StatelessClassRule: Add setAddToIgnoreFieldNames() method (adds to ignoreFieldNames).
 - Add new `<rule>.description.html` property for each rule. Change the HtmlReportWriter to look for `*.description.html` first; if not defined, use `*.description`. Continue to use `*.description` in XML report. Potential BREAKAGE: If you have overridden the `<rule>.description` message for a predefined rule in a "codenarc-messages.properties" file, you will have to change those message keys to `<rule>.description.html`.
 - Do not include disabled rules in list of rules at bottom of HTML/XML report.
 - HtmlReportWriter: Don?t log warning if "codenarc-messages.properties" contains `*.description` but not `*.description.html`.
 - UnusedVariableRule: Fix limitation: Does not recognize variable references on the same line as the variable declaration.
 - GroovyDslRuleSet: Throw MissingPropertyException if a non-existent property is set within a Groovy RuleSet DSL.
 - CodeNarcRunner: Add System.out println of summary counts.
 - MethodSizeRule: Apply to constructors as well.
 - WildcardPattern: Trim pattern values. This includes property values such as common rule properties applyToFileNames/doNotApplyToFileNames, applyToClassNames/doNotApplyToClassNames. Or many rule-specific properties such as ignoreMethodNames for the MethodSizeRule.
 - PropertiesFileRuleSetConfigurer: Log warning if rule name not found.
 - TESTS: AbstractRuleTestCase: Add assertViolations(String source, Map[] violationMaps) helper method.
 - TESTS: Fix tests broken on Linux.

Version 0.8.1 (2 Feb 2010)
------------------------------------

Bug Fixes
 - Fix Bug #2943025: "NestedBlockDepthRule: Produces erroneous results on Groovy 1.6.x." <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2943025&group_id=250145&atid=1126573>
 - Fix Bug #2943028: "PackageNameRule may show incorrect violations for classes within the default package when running in Groovy 1.6.x." <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2943028&group_id=250145&atid=1126573>
 - Fix Bug #2935587 "Building CodeNarc 0.8 fails."  - Problem from Joern Huxhorn (Jan 18, 2010) ? Unable to build from the downloaded CodeNarc-0.8-bin.tar.gz.  <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2935587&group_id=250145&atid=1126573>. See CodeNarc  - Unable to Build From TarGZip.doc. Remove platform/locale dependencies: AbstractReportWriterTest, UrlResourceTest, GrailsSessionReferenceRuleTest, GrailsPublicControllerMethodRuleTest, GrailsServletContextReferenceRuleTest, GrailsStatelessServiceRuleTest. [Jan 24]
 - Fix StackOverflow in Groovy 1.7.0 for some rules: All rules that implement the visitVariableExpression(VariableExpression expression) visitor method: UnusedVariableRule, UnusedPrivateFieldRule, GrailsSessionReferenceRule, GrailsServletContextReferenceRule ? Removed call to super.visitVariableExpression(expression) since that seems to cause problems (StackOverflow) in Groovy 1.7.0.
 - Fix tests broken when running in Groovy 1.6 or Groovy 1.7.
 - DuplicateImportRule: Document that this rule does not work when running under Groovy 1.7 (i.e., will not produce any violations), and does not distinguish between multiple duplicate imports for the same class.

Version 0.8 (17 Jan 2010)
------------------------------------

Bug Fixes
 - Fix Bug #2930886: "Cannot load rules when groovy is in different classloader".  XmlReaderRuleSet, ReportWriterFactory: Replace calls to Class.forName() with getClass().classLoader.loadClass(). <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=2930886&group_id=250145>.
 - Fix Bug #2847520: "UnusedVariableRule: Closure variable must be invoked". UnusedVariableRule: Referencing an (explicit) Closure variable without invoking it is not recognized as a valid reference. e.g., final CLOSURE = { .. }; return CLOSURE. <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2847520&group_id=250145&atid=1126573>
 - Fix false positive: Local closures: If a closure is assigned to a local variable, then used later in the method, CodeNarc report the variable unused. [I think this has already been resolved, perhaps as part of Bug #2847520]. (reported by Donal Murtagh)
 - Fix false positive: Default arguments: If a constant is only used as the value of a default argument, CodeNarc reports this constant unused. (reported by Donal Murtagh)

 - Fix BUG #2796953: StatelessClassRule requires applyToFileNames or applyToFilesMatching.  <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=2796953&group_id=250145>
 - Fix BUG #2811213: "FieldNameRule: Names for final fields  - not be all caps". FieldNameRule: Field names for final instance fields should not default to be all caps like static final fields. For instance: final List sentEmails = []. Rather, "If a property is declared final the private field is created final and no setter is generated." (<http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Beans>). So, they should be named with "normal" naming conventions. Re-purpose the finalRegex property to just apply to final instance fields and default to null so that final field names use same convention as non-final. <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2811213&group_id=250145&atid=1126573>.

 - CodeNarcRunner: Don't mandate that reportWriters is non-empty.

Other
 - Publish CodeNarc to Maven repository.
