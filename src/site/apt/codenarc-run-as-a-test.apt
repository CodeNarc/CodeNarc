                      CodeNarc - Run as a Test
        --------------------------------------------------

CodeNarc - Run as an Automated Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  <<CodeNarc>> can be run as part of an automated test suite, for instance using <<JUnit>> or <<TestNG>>.
  This approach uses the <<<org.codenarc.ant.CodeNarcTask>>> class and Groovy's built-in support for
  <<Apache Ant>>.

  <<NOTE:>> This approach may not play well with having <<CodeNarc>> also configured to run as part of
  your "regular" Ant build, especially if you have a classpath defined for your Ant build which is
  different that your runtime classpath for running your tests (which is likely).

* Automated Test That Runs CodeNarc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This is an example <<JUnit>> test (JUnit 3.x) that runs <<CodeNarc>>.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    private static final GROOVY_FILES = '**/*.groovy'
    private static final RULESET_FILES = [
            'rulesets/basic.xml',
            'rulesets/imports.xml'].join(',')

    void testRunCodeNarc() {
        def ant = new AntBuilder()

        ant.taskdef(name:'codenarc', classname:'org.codenarc.ant.CodeNarcTask')

        ant.codenarc(ruleSetFiles:RULESET_FILES,
           maxPriority1Violations:0, maxPriority2Violations:0) {

           fileset(dir:'src/main/groovy') {
               include(name:GROOVY_FILES)
           }
           fileset(dir:'src/test/groovy') {
               include(name:GROOVY_FILES)
           }

           report(type:'ide')
        }
    }
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Things to note:

  * This approach uses the <<<AntBuilder>>> class provided with Groovy.

  * The <<CodeNarc>> jar must be on the classpath. Any external resources that you reference must also
    be on the classpath, including any custom <RuleSet> files.

  * The <maxPriority1Violations> and <maxPriority2Violations> properties are configured to fail the test
    if any priority 1 or 2 violations are found.

  * An <ide> report is configured. This will to write (only) to <standard out>, and will include hyperlinks
    to the lines within the source code that contained the violations . The report shows the total number
    of violations (at each priority) and also list the violations by file.
