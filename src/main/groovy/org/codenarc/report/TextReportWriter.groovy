/**
 * ReportWriter that generates an simple ASCII text report.
 *
 * Set the maxPriority property to control the maximum priority level for violations in
 * the report. For instance, setting maxPriority to 2 will result in the report containing
 * only priority 1 and 2 violations (and omitting violations with priority 3). The
 * maxPriority property defaults to 3.
