/**
 * Rule that checks for references to the servletContext object from within Grails controller and
 * taglib classes.
 * <p/>
 * This rule is intended as a "governance" rule to enable monitoring and controlling access to the
 * servletContext from within application source code. Storing objects in the servletContext may
 * inhibit scalability and/or performance and should be carefully considered. Furthermore, access
 * to the servletContext is not synchronized, so reading/writing objects from the servletConext must
 * be manually synchronized, as described in <b>The Definitive Guide to Grails</b> (2nd edition).
 * <p/>
 * Enabling this rule may make most sense in a team environment where team members exhibit a broad
 * range of skill and experience levels. Appropriate servletContext access can be configured as
 * exceptions to this rule by configuring either the <code>doNotApplyToFilenames</code> or
 * <code>doNotApplyToFilesMatching</code> property of the rule.
 * <p/>
 * This rule sets the default value of <code>applyToFilesMatching</code> to only match files
 * under the 'grails-app/controllers' or 'grails-app/taglib' folders. You can override this
 * with a different regular expression value if appropriate.
