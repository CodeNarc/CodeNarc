/**
 * Rule that checks for references to the session object from within Grails controller and
 * taglib classes.
 * <p/>
 * This rule is intended as a "governance" rule to enable monitoring and controlling access to the
 * session from within application source code. Storing objects in the session may inhibit scalability
 * and/or performance and should be carefully considered.
 * <p/>
 * Enabling this rule may make most sense in a team environment where team members exhibit a broad
 * range of skill and experience levels. Appropriate session access can be configured as exceptions
 * to this rule by configuring either the <code>doNotApplyToFilenames</code> or
 * <code>doNotApplyToFilesMatching</code> property of the rule.
 * <p/>
 * This rule sets the default value of <code>applyToFilesMatching</code> to only match files
 * under the 'grails-app/controllers' or 'grails-app/taglib' folders. You can override this
 * with a different regular expression value if appropriate.
 *
 * @deprecated This rule is deprecated and disabled (enabled=false) by default
 *
